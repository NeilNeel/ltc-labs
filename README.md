# My Learn to Cloud Journey

## Current Progress: Phase 1 - Linux and Bash

I'm currently working through the Learn to Cloud challenge, focusing on mastering Linux and Bash fundamentals. This repository tracks my progress and contains my solutions and notes.

### Topic 1: Linux
- Read the book *Linux Basics for Hackers* until Chapter 9.
- Did few challengs inside the book.

### Topic 2: Version Control
- I already had previous experience with this, so I just revised the concepts.


#### Topic 3: Infrastructure as Code
- Learned the basics and focused on Terraform.
- Did a crash course from YouTube.

### Next Steps

After completing the current topics, I will tackle the Linux Command Line CTF Challenge. You can view the challenge in the `aws` folder.

## Resources

I'm following the curriculum outlined at [learntocloud.guide](https://learntocloud.guide).

## Goals

- Gain proficiency in Linux command line operations
- Understand and effectively use Git for version control
- Build a solid foundation for cloud computing concepts

I'm excited to continue this journey and look forward to progressing through all phases of the Learn to Cloud challenge!
