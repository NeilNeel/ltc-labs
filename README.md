# My Learn to Cloud Journey

## Current Progress: Phase 1 - Linux and Bash

I'm currently working through the Learn to Cloud challenge, focusing on mastering Linux and Bash fundamentals. This repository tracks my progress and contains my solutions and notes.

### Current Topic: Version Control

I'm learning about version control systems, particularly Git. This includes:

- Understanding the basics of Git
- Creating and cloning repositories
- Making commits
- Pushing changes to remote repositories
- Working with branches

### Next Steps

After completing the Version Control section, I'll be moving on to other Linux and Bash topics, including:

- File manipulation
- Text processing
- Bash scripting
- System administration basics

## Resources

I'm following the curriculum outlined at [learntocloud.guide](https://learntocloud.guide).

## Goals

- Gain proficiency in Linux command line operations
- Understand and effectively use Git for version control
- Build a solid foundation for cloud computing concepts

I'm excited to continue this journey and look forward to progressing through all phases of the Learn to Cloud challenge!
